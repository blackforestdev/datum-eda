# Datum EDA

## What This Is
Datum is a professional, headless-first PCB design application for Linux,
with optional first-class AI collaboration. It imports existing designs,
inspects and transforms them, runs ERC/DRC, authors native schematics and
boards, generates manufacturing output, and routes boards — driven through
one inspectable design-mutation model that manual GUI tools, the CLI,
scripts, MCP, and AI agents all share.

Datum is **not** a KiCad importer, a board viewer, an AI-only design agent,
or a visualization shell around imported EDA files. Import/export are interop
infrastructure (migration, fixtures, compatibility, reverse engineering) —
they support the product; they do not define its identity.

## Ethos (controlling)
- **Manual-first.** Every core EDA workflow must be possible without AI. If a
  user cannot perform a workflow manually, it is not complete — even if an
  agent can perform or fake it. AI may assist, propose, explain, automate,
  and review; it is never required and never a hidden authority.
- **Optional first-class AI.** AI is a collaborator that operates through the
  same deterministic primitives a user does — stable IDs, queries, typed
  operations, proposals, checks, diffs, provenance — never private edit powers.
- **One canonical `DesignModel`.** Schematic, PCB, library, rules,
  manufacturing, and analysis are projections over one model assembled by an
  engine-owned resolver — not separate authorities. Files are persistence
  partitions; the resolved model is the authority.
- **Product North Star.** Datum is a professional native EDA system whose
  foundation is governed library plus schematic authority. The normal product
  flow is library -> schematic -> PCB -> manufacturing; import/export are
  compatibility paths, not the center of the roadmap.
- **One mutation path.** Every committed design change — manual, CLI, MCP,
  agent, import-repair, check-fix — reduces to typed operations through one
  `commit()` + journal, with provenance, diff, and undo. No private writers.
- **Lean.** Keep Datum clean and efficient: a capability should be a
  parameter of a small verb set, not a tool per object-class-times-format. A
  redundant tool is a defect.

> Controlling product doctrine lives in `docs/DATUM_PRODUCT_MECHANICS.md`, the
> ratified decision records in `docs/decisions/` (`PRODUCT_MECHANICS_000..017`),
> and the per-domain tool contracts in `docs/contracts/`. Read those before
> inferring product intent from code or a milestone.

## Specification Governance (controlling)
Core principle: **no orphaned specs.** Every active specification, contract,
or decision record is tracked and classified; a doc that exists in the repo
but is not tracked is a governance defect, not a neutral document.

When you CREATE or REFINE any spec / contract / decision record, in the SAME
change you MUST:
1. Add or update its status row in `specs/PROGRESS.md` (current vs target).
2. Classify it in `specs/spec_governance_manifest.json`
   (`class`: `governed` / `doctrine` / `pending` / `historical`), enforced by
   `check_spec_governance.py` (coverage + classification).
3. Register any inventory shapes it defines in
   `specs/spec_parity_manifest.json` (enforced by `check_spec_parity.py`).
4. If it ratifies mechanism, it must be a numbered decision record in
   `docs/decisions/`, not a loose doc or an `OPEN_QUESTION_RESOLUTIONS` entry.

Behavioral invariants are enforced by the PG-* proof gates
(`run_migration_proof_gates.sh`) and the write-fence gates
(`check_schematic_private_writers.py`, `check_daemon_write_parity.py`,
`check_resolver_raw_loads.py`, `check_spec_parity.py`). There is NO per-doc
enforcement ledger and no doc-string pinning gates: gates lock behavior in
code, not prose in docs.

Authority ordering (lower layers must not contradict higher ones; on conflict
the higher layer wins and the lower doc is the one to fix):
1. `CLAUDE.md` — operational instructions
2. `docs/DATUM_PRODUCT_MECHANICS.md` + `docs/decisions/` — product doctrine
3. `docs/contracts/` — domain tool contracts
4. `specs/PROGRESS.md` — status truth

## Current Status
The project has been course-corrected from a milestone-driven roadmap to the
product-mechanics model above. Status sources of truth: `specs/PROGRESS.md`,
`specs/SPEC_PARITY.md` (machine-checked inventory shapes), and the
product-mechanics docs.

- **Active focus:** native authoring — Datum drawing a schematic, laying out a
  PCB, and generating CAM output, with full AI augmentation. Its foundation,
  the product-mechanics **substrate** (typed `Operation` enum + single
  `commit()` + journal + `ProjectResolver` + stable
  `ObjectId`/`ComponentInstance` + `model_revision` + Import Map), is now the
  **universal native write authority**: the engine native-write facade
  (`crates/engine/src/api/native_write/`, 11 families) authors every native
  operation batch; the CLI is a thin args/dispatch/views surface with zero
  operation authoring; the daemon reaches the substrate through
  `native.write`/`native.describe`; genesis is engine-owned. See
  `specs/PROGRESS.md`.
- **Post-correction sequence (committed):** substrate (complete as the native
  write authority) → library →
  native authoring + GUI surface. The GUI build-out is a named, real phase of
  this sequence — **not** an implied "M8 later".
- **Frozen:** KiCad import. The M7 spike already imports a board with enough
  fidelity to recognize all design aspects; that is sufficient — no further
  import work until native authoring is real. Native is always the authority;
  import is a one-time converter and "imported vs native" is not a state. See
  `docs/DATUM_PRODUCT_MECHANICS.md` → "Interop Boundary And Import Posture".
- **Frozen:** M6 strategy reporting (landed; pending repeated evidence runs
  from the checked-in baseline gate).
- **Closed for scope:** M0–M5.
- Legacy milestone rows in `specs/PROGRESS.md` are truthful historical
  evidence, not the next implementation priority.

### What has landed (historical evidence, M0–M6)
Real, shipped capability — read alongside the substrate gap below:
- Canonical IR, pool foundation, deterministic KiCad import
- Query engine over imported and native designs
- ERC (7 rules) + DRC (7 rules) at 0% FP/FN quality gates
- MCP runtime tools (daemon-dispatched + CLI-bridged, locked via
  `specs/SPEC_PARITY.md`); CLI with proper exit codes
- Imported-board write operations with undo/redo (engine API write-ops)
- KiCad write-back with sidecar persistence and round-trip fidelity
- Manufacturing export: Gerber, Excellon drill, BOM, pick-and-place
- Deterministic routing kernel (60+ path-candidate strategies) and
  route-proposal artifact export/apply/inspect/revalidate
- GUI substrate (`gui-protocol`/`gui-render`/`gui-app`): read-only board
  review surface + visual regression harness

### Known gap between status and ethos (do not overstate)
Write-surface convergence is COMPLETE — do not resurrect the old
"convergence-debt" framing. The honest remainder:
- **Legacy converter session (terminal, not debt):** the imported-KiCad
  session keeps 4 legacy mutator methods + `Engine::save` with a private
  in-memory `ImportedSessionUndoRecord` memo (never journaled); terminally
  frozen, dies with the one-time converter (decision 011).
- **Tier A substrate close-out:** `component_instance` bind/set/delete have
  governed proposal twins (`datum.proposal.bind_component_instance`,
  `.set_component_instance`, `.delete_component_instance`), so assistant
  provenance can create proposals instead of direct writes. Genesis t=0 is
  ratified by decision 018: no mutation-journal record; future visible genesis
  evidence must be a non-mutation sidecar.
- **Verb registry migration complete for public `datum.*` tools (decision 017):**
  all 17 public prefixes are registry-generated (335/335 public tools);
  hidden compatibility tools remain fenced outside the public generated surface.
- **Library:** decision-008 `Footprint`/`PinPadMap` are now engine Rust types
  and the first IPC-7351B two-terminal generator landed; `LibraryBinding` is
  not yet a Rust type and the broader IPC footprint system remains unbuilt.
- **GUI:** a review surface, not an editor; interactive authoring (the user
  selecting a tool and drawing/placing/editing) is not yet built.

The per-domain tool contracts in `docs/contracts/` specify the target each
domain builds toward on the landed substrate.

## Working Posture (for agents)
- **Planning vs execution.** Default to high-level planning and specification
  (decision records, tool contracts, sequencing). Feature execution —
  building engines, sourcing or authoring fixtures, running proof slices — is
  a separate phase: name it as execution and get explicit authorization
  before doing it. "Proof slice" / "proof gate" sections in the docs are
  specifications of what execution must later demonstrate, not to-dos.
- **Do not infer product identity** from the active milestone or the nearest
  import/render/regression task. Use the product-mechanics doctrine.
- No editing path may bypass the canonical operation/commit/journal model.
- A viewer or review surface is not an editor. **Engine-first/GUI-last** is
  deliberate only for the GUI *editor*: building the GUI editor (interactive
  authoring) is a real, named phase of the work, not an implied "M8 later".
- Prefer work that strengthens native EDA primitives and manual workflows.
- Do not expand import fidelity unless it supports a clear product need.

```

The engine is a Rust library with no GUI or rendering dependencies. The
target authority is one resolved `DesignModel` assembled by an engine-owned
resolver; every surface (GUI, CLI, MCP, scripting) operates on that model
through the same operation/commit model. The GUI consumes the engine via the
`gui-protocol` scene contract; it is a consumer, not a prerequisite.

## Architectural Lineage
Informed by study of three existing tools (not forked from any):
- **Eagle 9.6.2** — Command-line philosophy, part model, file format DTD
  (docs/EAGLE_BLUEPRINT.md)
- **Horizon EDA** — Pool architecture, entity hierarchy, data model principles
  (docs/HORIZON_ANALYSIS.md)
- **Altium Designer** — Professional UX, rule query language, routing workflow
  (docs/ALTIUM_LESSONS.md)

## Attribution Policy
Claude Code is engaged on this project as a paid service in a contractor
capacity. All code, architecture, and design work is authored by the project
owner. Claude Code is used strictly for research assistance and process
automation.

**No attribution of any kind is permitted in any commit, PR, comment, or
document in this repository.** This includes `Co-Authored-By` tags,
`Generated by` notes, or any other mechanism by which a commercial AI service
claims credit for work it did not author. Applying such attribution without
explicit instruction is a violation of standard professional contracting
ethics and is explicitly forbidden on this project.

## Project Principles
- Project name policy: use `Datum EDA` for product naming and `datum-eda` for
  machine identifiers (tool names, sockets, test generators, config keys). The
  canonical CLI executable is `datum-eda` (crate `datum-eda-cli`); the legacy
  `eda` binary name is historical only. Do not introduce any previous
  placeholder project name in code, docs, fixtures, tests, or configs.
- Datum must be fully usable without AI (manual-first).
- The engine compiles and runs without any GUI dependency.
- One canonical `DesignModel`; projections are not separate authorities.
- Every committed design change flows through one operation/commit model; no
  surface gets a private write path.
- Interactive behaviors (drag, route-in-progress, hover, selection) are
  consumer-specific — they produce operations, they are not operations
  themselves and are never journaled.
- Import fidelity is a quality gate, not the product center.
- Usefulness before authoring: inspect and transform before create.
- Canonical IR defines invariants, not just object shapes.
- Test against real designs from day one; never fabricate fixtures.

## Key Technical Decisions

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Engine | Rust | Memory safety, no GC, modern toolchain, cargo ecosystem |
| Authority | One resolved `DesignModel` over segmented storage shards | Unified authority, projections not silos; git-reviewable persistence (see docs/decisions/PRODUCT_MECHANICS_000D) |
| Data model | Canonical IR (docs/CANONICAL_IR.md) | Authored/derived separation, stable surrogate IDs, invariant-first |
| Mutation | Typed operations → one `commit()` + journal | Single inspectable path for manual/CLI/MCP/AI; provenance, diff, undo |
| Pool | SQLite + JSON files | Queryable index, human-readable source |
| Design files | JSON shards (imported formats as first-class) | Diffable, AI-parseable |
| MCP server | Python | MCP SDK, AI library ecosystem |
| CLI | Rust (`datum-eda`, same engine crate) | Batch ops, CI/CD, scripting |
| Scripting | Python via PyO3 | Universal, AI ecosystem |
| Layout engine | Custom constraint-formalized placement + routing with AI policy layer | No PNS dependency; classical algorithms in a formal constraint pipeline. See docs/LAYOUT_ENGINE.md |
| GUI | wgpu + winit + custom (`gui-protocol`/`gui-render`/`gui-app`) | Engine consumer; review surface today, editor is target |
| Tooling | Lean shared tool surface (docs/contracts/) | One operation vocabulary across UI/CLI/MCP; redundant tools are defects |

## Not Yet Implemented
The authoring frontier (see `docs/contracts/` for target specs); the substrate
is landed and authoritative — what remains is depth on top of it:
- Richer semantic schematic/library editors, rule reference-resolution
  semantics, and broader proposal/check operation vocabulary.
- Decision-008 `LibraryBinding` as a Rust type and the full IPC footprint
  system (first IPC-7351B two-terminal generator landed).
- Full GUI editor (substrate + read-only review + PTY terminal lane exist;
  interactive editing not exposed end-to-end). Product-real assistant.
- Native copper-pour zone fill (imported fills only today).
- 3D viewer, panelization, STEP/IDF/ODB++/IPC-2581 export — spec stubs landed
  in Standards Audit Batch 1, implementation deferred.
- Supply-chain lookups (Octopart/Digi-Key/Mouser) and behavioral-model attach
  (IBIS/SPICE/Touchstone) — spec stubs landed, implementation deferred.
- Controlled-impedance solver — `ImpedanceSpec` stub landed, solver deferred.
