# Board Editor Conformance Spec (prototype → build, with check dispositions)

> **Status**: active / governed.
> **Ratified under**: decision 019 (GUI product-model recovery) on the systems of
> decisions 014 (layout) + 015 (design system).
> **This doc does NOT redefine the target.** The controlling visual prototype
> `docs/gui/prototypes/board-editor.html` and the Design Book
> `docs/gui/VISUAL_LANGUAGE.md` remain authoritative for *what the board editor
> is*. This spec makes each conformance claim **executable and honestly
> dispositioned** so the Phase-1 build can be driven to match the prototype and
> drift is caught. It is a governance extension of `DATUM_GUI_PHASE_1_SPEC.md`,
> not a rival design.
> **Contract of this document:** *every claim below is actionable and carries
> exactly one honest check disposition* (ENFORCED / TO-ENFORCE / HUMAN), each with
> a named link. No claim is left as unverifiable prose.

## 0. Authority & reference chain (read this first)

The reference chain has a **direction**, and the two ends are checked by different
machinery:

- **Chrome & layout (regions, geometry, composition):** the reference *image* is
  `docs/gui/prototypes/board-editor.html`. It is a mockup you look at, not a value
  source you diff against.
- **Tokens / type / spacing / radius (values):** the machine-authoritative source
  is `docs/gui/VISUAL_LANGUAGE.md` §2, mirrored into
  `crates/gui-render/src/design_tokens.rs`. **The prototype's `:root` font-stacks
  (`--sans: ui-sans-serif …`, `--mono: ui-monospace …`) and its hand-tuned pixel
  values (`height:33px`, `font-size:13.5px`, `--row:25px`, …) are placeholder
  mockup values, NOT conformance targets.** Where the prototype px and the Design
  Book token disagree, the token wins and the prototype is the doc to fix (or the
  delta is logged in §5 as an owner reconciliation).

**Hard rule, stated once and binding everywhere in this doc:** a Rust/wgpu render
will **never** pixel-match an HTML/CSS render. **No check anywhere in this spec
pixel-diffs the build against `board-editor.html`.** The two layers are:

- **Machine layer** — token values, layout metrics, component structure, and
  rendered *goldens diffed against committed golden PNGs* (build-vs-build, same
  renderer). This is where ENFORCED / TO-ENFORCE live.
- **Human layer** — the committed reference image (`board-editor.html`) reviewed
  by the owner against the committed **chrome goldens**
  (`crates/gui-render/testdata/golden/board/datum-test.scale-*.golden.png`) for
  cross-engine fidelity and aesthetic/IA judgment. This is where HUMAN lives.

### 0.1 The composed-shell visual-parity gate (fixes the paperwork defect)

Historically the *composed shell look* was every per-row **HUMAN** disposition
in §2 and nothing else — reviewed against a reference image that existed only as
`docs/gui/reference/board-editor.png.PENDING`, with `check_gui_conformance.py`
merely *reporting* HUMAN rows and never failing on them. That gate enforced
paperwork, not the visual outcome.

That paperwork defect is closed by a **real, same-engine, FAILING gate over a
SINGLE-PANE INTERIM target**: `scripts/check_gui_visual_parity.py` captures the
running app at a canonical command (`--board <datum-test path> --select R1
--visual-test --window-size 1680x1050 --exit-after-screenshot` — the datum-test
board with a preset R1 component selection, a populated **single-pane**
composition: board + inspector) and diffs it against a committed **shell golden**
`crates/gui-render/testdata/golden/shell/datum-shell.golden.png` with a small
tolerance (build-vs-build, one renderer — **never** a wgpu-vs-HTML pixel-diff).
The gate then **fails** on any regression from that frozen look, and is wired into
`check_gui_conformance.py` (hence `run_drift_gates.sh`). Re-capture is an explicit
owner action: `check_gui_visual_parity.py --bless`.

**Honest scope — do not overstate what this golden is.** This shell golden is a
**single-pane interim** target and is **NOT owner-approved against
`board-editor.html`**. The prototype is a **SPLIT Board+Schematic composition with
a populated inspector**; that full composition **cannot** be captured until the
split view + schematic pane are built in **Phase-2** (there is no config
shortcut — `DATUM_GUI_PHASE_2_SPEC.md` P2.1). What this gate buys today is
strictly *no silent regression of the current single-pane shell look* — it does
**not** certify prototype parity. The one-time owner cross-engine approval of the
full board-editor composition is tracked separately by the reference-capture loop
(`docs/gui/reference/README.md` + `scripts/check_gui_reference_capture.py`), which
is **EXPECTED RED until Phase-2** because no owner-approved `board-editor.png`
reference exists yet.

**Reading the §2 HUMAN rows now:** each still names the *aesthetic/IA judgment*
(the one-time owner call that a region matches the prototype). The composed
single-pane result is regression-gated by §0.1 so the current look does not
silently drift; the *full split-view* composed judgment against the prototype is
Phase-2 work and is not yet enforced or approved.

## 1. Disposition legend (the discipline of this pilot)

Three dispositions, and only three. **Every row names a link** — a disposition
without a concrete reference is not a valid row.

| Disposition | Meaning | Link requirement |
|---|---|---|
| **ENFORCED** | A real existing gate / test / golden verifies this claim **today**. | Must name the file + gate/test function that verifies it now. |
| **TO-ENFORCE** | Machine-checkable, but the gate does **not** exist yet. | Must name the exact test/gate **file + the assertion to add**. **RULE:** never mark a TO-ENFORCE green, and never land it **red against un-built structure** — it lands *with the build slice it verifies*. |
| **HUMAN** | Not machine-verifiable (cross-engine pixel fidelity, aesthetic / IA / owner-eye / token-value judgment). | Must name the **reference image** + the committed **golden** it is reviewed against. |

No row proposes pixel-diffing wgpu against HTML. No row is uncomputable-yet-marked-green.

**Golden-backed-HUMAN rule (closes the paperwork hole).** A **HUMAN** disposition
for a *whole-surface* visual outcome (the composed look of the shell, or of any
whole surface) may **NOT** be the sole guardian of that outcome. It MUST be backed
by a **committed golden** that a machine gate regression-checks
build-vs-build (§2.10 / G9). For the current shell that golden is a **single-pane
interim** target frozen against regression — **not** an owner-approval of
prototype parity (the split-view cross-engine judgment against `board-editor.html`
is Phase-2 work, tracked by the reference-capture loop, currently RED). The
ENFORCED half is "no regression from the committed golden." A `*.PENDING` placeholder can
**never** satisfy this — an absent or PENDING-shadowed golden FAILS the gate. This
is the exact defect being corrected: previously the composed shell look was every
per-row HUMAN disposition and nothing else, reviewed against an image that existed
only as `docs/gui/reference/board-editor.png.PENDING`, with the aggregate merely
*reporting* HUMAN rows and never failing. (Per-region HUMAN rows for a *sub-region's*
feel remain valid on their own; this rule binds only whole-surface outcomes.)

## 2. Per-region conformance tables

Nine audited regions, all covered: **menu-bar · tool-rail · project-tree ·
layers-panel · board-pane · inspector · dock · status-bar · typography-tokens.**
Row shape: **claim | prototype value | build state | phase scope | disposition |
check ref.** Rows are transcribed from the region audits — a faithful
transcription, not a re-derivation.

Legend for *phase scope*: **P1** = Phase-1 in-scope (read-only board review);
**DEF** = deferred (authoring / other surfaces, per `DATUM_GUI_PHASE_1_SPEC.md`).

### 2.1 Menu-bar
*Phase scope: P1 (chrome present; items rendered from manifest, mutating items
disabled).* **Headline:** structure + token fill are enforced; the one real gap is
title **width tuning** (item 3) — enforced by the condensed advance metric test.

| Claim | Prototype value | Build state | Phase | Disposition | Check ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Menu bar is the top strip, full width, single row | `.menubar` `height:33px` `flex:0 0 33px` | `ShellLayout.top_menu_bar`, `height = SP_07 + SP_01 = 34px` | P1 | ENFORCED | `layout_invariant_tests.rs::shell_and_hit_regions_hold_layout_invariants_across_scale_matrix` (PG-UI-LAYOUT-INVARIANTS) |

---

### 2.2 Tool-rail
*Phase scope: P1 chrome region exists in the pane header.* **Headline:** the
region-existence conflict is resolved: the prototype has **no** standalone left
tool rail; tools live per-pane in `.pane-tools`, and the build now follows that.

| Claim | Prototype value | Build state | Phase | Disposition | Check ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standalone left tool rail is absent | **absent** — tools are per-pane (`.pane-tools` inside `.pane-hd`) | `ShellLayout` has no `tool_rail` column | P1 | ENFORCED | `layout_invariant_tests.rs::shell_and_hit_regions_hold_layout_invariants_across_scale_matrix` |

---

### 2.3 Project-tree
*Phase scope: P1 (read-only navigation).* **Headline:** panel + selected-row token
structure enforced; tree content is fixture-driven; row density (`--row:25px`) is a
placeholder px not a token target.

| Claim | Prototype value | Build state | Phase | Disposition | Check ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tree lives in the left column, above Layers | `.col.left` `flex:0 0 224px` | `ShellLayout.left_sidebar`, `left_width = 228px` | P1 | ENFORCED | `layout_invariant_tests.rs` (columns don't overlap; cards within sidebar) |
| Panel header: uppercase, secondary text, count on right | `.panel-hd` 28px, 11.5px/600, `--tx2`; `.count` mono `--tx3` | header from `type.header` + `TEXT_SECONDARY`, count `TEXT_MUTED` mono | P1 | ENFORCED | `check_gui_design_tokens.py` (values); *usage* → §4 gap |
| Selected row: accent tint + left accent rule | `.tree-row.sel{background:var(--acc-tint);box-shadow:inset 2px 0 0 var(--acc)}` | `REVIEW_ROW_ACTIVE_BG = ACCENT_TINT` + accent rule | P1 | ENFORCED | `check_gui_design_tokens.py` (ACCENT/ACCENT_TINT values) |
| Row height / indent ladder (l2 26 / l3 44) | `--row:25px`, `l2:26px`, `l3:44px` | row height from spacing tokens (px is placeholder, not a target) | P1 | HUMAN | ref image vs golden (density judged, not px-diffed) |
| Content: project → Schematic[pane B] / Board[pane A]·sel → Components 24 / Nets 41; Library → Footprints 18 / Symbols 22 | literal tree markup | tree from resolved fixture model | P1 | HUMAN | ref image vs `datum-test.scale-*.golden.png` |

---

### 2.4 Layers-panel
*Phase scope: P1 (read-only; visibility toggles as view state).* **Headline:**
swatch→content-token mapping is value-gated but **not usage-gated** (which swatch
binds which layer token is untested — §4).

| Claim | Prototype value | Build state | Phase | Disposition | Check ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Layers panel sits below the tree in the left column | `.panel` `flex:0 0 auto`, header "Layers" | left-column lower panel | P1 | ENFORCED | `layout_invariant_tests.rs` |
| Active layer row: accent tint + left accent rule | `.layer-row.active` same as tree sel | active-row accent tint | P1 | ENFORCED | `check_gui_design_tokens.py` (ACCENT_TINT) |

| **Which swatch binds which content token** (usage) | swatch `style="background:var(--cu-f)"` etc. | layer→token binding in render path | P1 | ENFORCED | `render_contract_tests.rs::conformance_region_token_bindings_follow_design_book` |
| Off/hidden layer dimming (Ratsnest) | `.layer-row.off{opacity:.4}` + `--tx3` name | visibility dim state | P1 | HUMAN | ref image vs golden |

---

### 2.5 Board-pane
*Phase scope: P1 (the protagonist — board rendered from resolved model, read-only).*
**Headline:** render fidelity is golden-backed, but **two concrete defects** live
here: golden capture framing (item 1) and overlay-text overflow (item 2).

| Claim | Prototype value | Build state | Phase | Disposition | Check ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Canvas is the deepest stage, distinct from chrome | `.pane{background:var(--canvas)}` `#0B0C0E` | `CANVAS` / board-field surface | P1 | ENFORCED | `check_gui_design_tokens.py` (CANVAS value) |
| Layer render stack order (back→front, group ladder) | copper under silk under edge (visual) | `scene_layer_stack_priority` ladder | P1 | ENFORCED | `render_contract_tests.rs::render_stack_policy_follows_declared_contract` |
| Copper built from tokens, not raw literals | `--cu-f/--cu-b` widths, glow | material-first copper from `design_tokens::content` | P1 | ENFORCED | `check_gui_design_tokens.py` copper-consumption guard (`from_copper_material([…])` fence) |
| Selection = accent outline + glow (cross-probed U1) | `stroke:var(--acc)` + `#glow` filter | accent selection material | P1 | ENFORCED (value) / HUMAN (look) | value: `check_gui_design_tokens.py`; look: ref image vs golden |
| **Golden captures the board fit-to-bounds** (item 1) | mockup shows board filling the pane | `camera_for_manifest` centers scene bounds and uses fit zoom | P1 | ENFORCED | `visual_runner.rs::conformance_golden_camera_frames_board_fit_to_bounds` |
| **Overlay hint stays within the viewport** (item 2) | n/a (mockup has no overflowing hint) | hint is clipped to `layout.viewport` | P1 | ENFORCED | `layout_invariant_tests.rs::shell_and_hit_regions_hold_layout_invariants_across_scale_matrix` |

---

### 2.6 Inspector
*Phase scope: P1 (read-only reflection of current selection).* **Headline:**
right-column structure + accent/field tokens enforced; content is selection-driven;
editability is deferred.

| Claim | Prototype value | Build state | Phase | Disposition | Check ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Inspector is the right column, follows focused pane | `.col.right` `flex:0 0 296px`, `follows pane A` | `ShellLayout.right_sidebar`, `right_width = 300px` | P1 | ENFORCED | `layout_invariant_tests.rs` (right-panel cards within sidebar, no overlap) |

---

### 2.7 Dock
*Phase scope: P1 read-only terminal lane; journal echo deferred.* **Headline:**
**collapsed-height conflict** and **journal CLI-string handoffs** are reconciled.

| Claim | Prototype value | Build state | Phase | Disposition | Check ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dock is a strip above the status bar, full width | `.dock` `flex:0 0 32px` | `ShellLayout.bottom_strip` | P1 | ENFORCED | `layout_invariant_tests.rs` |
| **Collapsed dock height** | `32px` | `ShellLayout` collapsed/default dock height = `SP_07` / 32px | P1 | ENFORCED | `lib.rs::tests::shell_layout_reserves_bottom_dock_and_viewport` |

| Terminal is a real shell GUI never writes to (decision 005) | mockup only | PTY lane, `render_terminal_lane` | P1 | ENFORCED | `terminal_dock_contract_tests.rs` |
| Journal command handoffs | n/a | journal commands are not projected into terminal handoffs | P1 | ENFORCED | `terminal_dock_contract_tests.rs`; `terminal_command_catalog.rs` filters `datum.journal.*` |

---

### 2.8 Status-bar
*Phase scope: P1 (reflects engine/selection truth).* **Headline:** the DRC cell
**correctly** uses chrome `STATUS_WARN`, not content `DRC_WARN` — this pre-answers
item 4 for this region.

| Claim | Prototype value | Build state | Phase | Disposition | Check ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Status bar is the bottom-most strip, full width | `.status` `flex:0 0 26px`, `--s01` bg | `ShellLayout.status_bar`, `height = SP_06 + SP_01 = 26px`, `SURFACE_01` | P1 | ENFORCED | `layout_invariant_tests.rs`; `check_gui_design_tokens.py` (SURFACE_01) |

---

### 2.9 Typography-tokens
*Phase scope: P1 (all rendered chrome text).* **Headline:** color tokens are gated;
**the type ramp, spacing, and radius modules are hand-mirrored with NO gate**
(§4). Two live defects: menu advance (item 3) and an **unreachable Medium weight
tier**.

| Claim | Prototype value | Build state | Phase | Disposition | Check ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| UI sans = IBM Plex Sans (Condensed cut bundled) | prototype `--sans` is a **placeholder** system stack (NOT a target) | `TextFace::Ui` → "IBM Plex Sans Condensed" (`text_attrs`, `lib.rs:6226`) | P1 | ENFORCED | Design Book §2.4 is authoritative; font load `load_datum_fonts`; prototype stack explicitly not conformance-relevant (§0) |

| **Menu advance factor** (item 3) | Plex Condensed narrower than 0.78 | condensed UI advance guarded against retired 0.78 path | P1 | ENFORCED | `menu_chrome.rs::conformance_menu_title_width_uses_condensed_measured_advance` |
| **Weight tiers reachable** (type.strong / type.micro = Medium 500) | book §2.4 assigns Medium 500 | `TextFace::UiMedium` selects `Weight::MEDIUM` | P1 | ENFORCED | `lib.rs::tests::conformance_medium_type_tiers_resolve_to_medium_weight` |
| **DRC marker colors** (item 4) — **already specced/approved in the prototype** | prototype renders ALL checks/DRC in the muted `--err #E5534B` / `--warn #E0A23A` (CHECKS panel count, `SPI2_SCK ⚠`, status `.warnc`) | `content.drc.*` aliases to muted `STATUS_ERROR/STATUS_WARN` | P1 | ENFORCED | `check_gui_design_tokens.py`; `render_contract_tests.rs::conformance_region_token_bindings_follow_design_book` |

---

### 2.10 Single-pane shell no-regression (interim)
*Phase scope: P1 (the composed look of the current SINGLE-PANE shell, not the full
split-view prototype, and not a single region).*
**Headline:** the current single-pane shell look is frozen into a committed
**shell golden** and regression-gated same-engine, so it does not silently drift.
This is **not** prototype-parity certification: the prototype `board-editor.html`
is a **split Board+Schematic composition with a populated inspector**, which
cannot be captured until **Phase-2** (`DATUM_GUI_PHASE_2_SPEC.md` P2.1) builds the
split view + schematic pane. The whole-split-shell composed judgment against the
prototype is tracked by the reference-capture loop
(`scripts/check_gui_reference_capture.py`), **EXPECTED RED until Phase-2**.

| Claim | Reference | Build state | Phase | Disposition | Check ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| No regression of the current single-pane shell look (interim; NOT prototype-parity) | committed single-pane shell golden | app single-pane shell | P1 | ENFORCED | `scripts/check_gui_visual_parity.py` vs `crates/gui-render/testdata/golden/shell/datum-shell.golden.png` |
| Full board-editor.html composition parity (split Board+Schematic, populated inspector) | prototype `board-editor.html` | not built (single-pane) | P2 | HUMAN (gated on Phase-2) | reference-capture loop `scripts/check_gui_reference_capture.py` + `docs/gui/reference/README.md` (RED until captured) |

**Canonical capture (fixed; the golden was captured at exactly these parameters and
the gate re-runs them):**

```bash
cargo run -q -p datum-gui-app --bin datum-gui --features visual -- \
  --board /home/bfadmin/Documents/kicad_projects/Datum-eda/datum-test/datum-test.kicad_pcb \
  --select R1 --visual-test \
  --screenshot-out <tmp>/datum-shell.capture.png \
  --window-size 1680x1050 --exit-after-screenshot
```

Fixed inputs: launch bin `datum-gui`, the datum-test board + preset R1 selection
(a populated **single-pane** composition — board + inspector — NOT the split
board-editor.html composition), `--visual-test` deterministic offscreen path,
window `1680x1050`. **Semantic guards** (`guard_intended_fixture`): the capture
fixture must be a real board whose layer stack includes `F.Cu` / `B.Cu` /
`F.SilkS` / `Edge.Cuts` and must NOT be the synthetic `Datum GUI Known Good` demo
scene, so a wrong scene cannot be blessed. The split-pane / U1 / STM32 content
guards are **deferred to Phase-2** (they cannot be asserted until the split view
renders them). **Tolerances
(same-engine, so near-identical — verified at 0 differing px on the reference
workstation):** dimensions must match exactly (hard fail otherwise); then (a) the
fraction of pixels differing by more than **8/255** on any channel must be **< 0.5%**,
AND (b) the **mean per-channel difference** must be **< 1.5/255**. Any real chrome
regression (a moved panel, a re-introduced uppercase run, a resurrected ON/OFF
badge, the floating-card border) blows past this and FAILS. Capture-infra failure
(no GPU/offscreen path) FAILS LOUD — the gate never silently passes. Re-approval is
an explicit owner action: `scripts/check_gui_visual_parity.py --bless`. This is the
sanctioned **build-vs-build** golden of §0's Machine layer, extended from the board
sub-region to the whole shell — **not** the forbidden wgpu-vs-HTML cross-engine diff.

## 3. The four polish items — where they land (index)

Folded in as first-class rows above, not a sidebar:

1. **Golden fit-to-board framing** → §2.5 board-pane, **ENFORCED**
   (`conformance_golden_camera_frames_board_fit_to_bounds` in `visual_runner.rs`; not a pixel-diff).
2. **Overlay-text overflow** → §2.5 board-pane, **ENFORCED** (`layout_invariant_tests.rs`;
   fixed via `draw_text_clipped`).
3. **Menu-width tuning** → §2.1 menu-bar + §2.9 typography, **ENFORCED**
   (condensed advance + two-sided menu metric test in `menu_chrome.rs`).
4. **DRC marker colors** → §2.9 typography, **ENFORCED** — build fix, not an owner
   decision: DRC is **already specced/approved in the prototype** as the muted
   `--err/--warn`; the build's separate hot `DRC_*` tokens diverge and must be
   reconciled to those values. Back-side silk is a **recorded prototype gap** (dimmer
   default kept). (Status-bar already uses chrome `STATUS_WARN` correctly.)

## 4. Machine-layer gap register (checks added)

A build/test agent's to-do list, distinct from the prose. Each lands **with the
slice it verifies**, never red against un-built structure.

- **G1 — Typography / spacing / radius parity arm.** ENFORCED by
  `scripts/check_gui_design_tokens.py`.
- **G2 — Prototype-parity arm.** ENFORCED by `scripts/check_gui_design_tokens.py`
  parsing `board-editor.html` `:root` for the approved subset. Still not a pixel
  check — value parity only.
- **G3 — Region token-binding contract tests.** ENFORCED by
  `render_contract_tests.rs::conformance_region_token_bindings_follow_design_book`.
- **G4 — Ad-hoc color lint.** ENFORCED by `scripts/check_gui_design_tokens.py`
  against the retired chrome literals, including the old board-field border.
- **G5 — Weight-tier resolution test.** ENFORCED by
  `lib.rs::tests::conformance_medium_type_tiers_resolve_to_medium_weight`.
- **G6 — Golden fit-to-board framing.** ENFORCED by
  `visual_runner.rs::conformance_golden_camera_frames_board_fit_to_bounds`.
- **G7 — Overlay-within-viewport.** ENFORCED by `layout_invariant_tests.rs`.
- **G8 — Two-sided menu-layout metric.** ENFORCED by
  `menu_chrome.rs::conformance_menu_title_width_uses_condensed_measured_advance`.
- **G9 — Single-pane shell no-regression gate (interim).** ENFORCED by
  `scripts/check_gui_visual_parity.py` (committed single-pane shell golden
  `crates/gui-render/testdata/golden/shell/datum-shell.golden.png`; captures the
  running app at the §2.10 canonical command and fails on any regression from the
  frozen single-pane look, fails if the golden is absent or a `*.PENDING`
  placeholder shadows it, applies the `guard_intended_fixture` semantic guards, and
  fails loud on capture-infra failure — never silently passes). Wired into
  `check_gui_conformance.py` (hence `run_drift_gates.sh`). This gate is **interim
  single-pane no-regression, NOT prototype-parity** — the full board-editor.html
  composition (split view) is Phase-2 and its owner approval is tracked by G10.
- **G10 — Reference-capture gate (EXPECTED RED until Phase-2).** ENFORCED by
  `scripts/check_gui_reference_capture.py` (wired into `run_drift_gates.sh`): FAILS
  while `docs/gui/reference/board-editor.png` is missing or a `*.PENDING`
  placeholder exists. This red is the **honest signal** that no owner-approved
  reference of the full board-editor.html split composition has been captured yet;
  it is not a bug and must not be silenced with a fabricated image. It resolves
  when the owner captures the reference (per `docs/gui/reference/README.md` §2) —
  which becomes possible/meaningful once Phase-2 builds the split view.

## 5. Reconciliation register (resolved in this conformance pass)

This spec **records** these; it does not resolve them. Structural checks that depend
on them are non-authoritative until the owner decides.

- **(a) Tool-rail region existence.** Resolved to prototype parity: tools live
  per-pane; `ShellLayout` has no standalone `tool_rail`.
- **(b) Dock collapsed height.** Resolved to 32px / `SP_07`; layout and
  app resize clamp both use the prototype target.
- **(c) Journal CLI-string handoffs.** Resolved: journal commands are not rendered
  or projected as terminal handoffs. Future execution belongs to the GUI write
  path.
- **(d) Route menu ctx-muting + font choice.** Data mono is ratified as IBM Plex
  Mono. Route ctx-muting remains HUMAN/owner-eye because it is visual policy, not
  a machine parity gap.

## 6. Coverage validation

- All **9** regions present (§2.1–§2.9), plus the single-pane shell no-regression
  row (§2.10, ENFORCED via G9) that regression-gates the current *single-pane*
  composed look, and the full-split-composition row (§2.10, HUMAN, gated on
  Phase-2 via G10 — currently RED, no owner-approved reference captured).
- Every line item carries **exactly one** of ENFORCED / TO-ENFORCE / HUMAN (rows
  marked "ENFORCED (value) / HUMAN (look)" split a *value* claim from a distinct
  *appearance* claim — each half carries one disposition).
- **No row pixel-diffs wgpu against `board-editor.html`.**
- Every **TO-ENFORCE** names a concrete file + assertion (§4 G1–G9; §2 rows).
- Every **HUMAN** names the reference image (`board-editor.html`) + the committed
  golden (`crates/gui-render/testdata/golden/board/datum-test.scale-*.golden.png`).
- The **current single-pane shell look** (the aggregate of the §2 HUMAN rows on
  the single-pane build) is regression-gated by §0.1 — the same-engine shell
  visual-parity gate (`scripts/check_gui_visual_parity.py` vs
  `crates/gui-render/testdata/golden/shell/datum-shell.golden.png`), wired into
  `check_gui_conformance.py`. The owner captures the interim golden; the gate
  fails on drift. This is single-pane no-regression, **not** prototype parity —
  the **full split-view board-editor.html composition** is Phase-2 and its
  owner-approved reference is tracked by G10
  (`scripts/check_gui_reference_capture.py`), correctly RED until captured. Visual
  parity of the current shell is no longer report-only paperwork; parity of the
  full prototype is honestly marked as not-yet-built.

## 7. Pilot status — the discipline generalizes (future doc-by-doc pass)

This document is the **pilot application** of a governance discipline, not a
one-off. The discipline is:

> **Every claim in a GUI spec must carry exactly one honest check disposition —
> ENFORCED (a named existing gate/test/golden), TO-ENFORCE (a named machine check
> to add with the slice it verifies, never faked green or landed red against
> un-built structure), or HUMAN (reviewed against a committed reference image /
> golden; never a pixel-diff of wgpu against HTML).** No claim is left as
> unverifiable prose.

The board editor was chosen as the pilot because it is the first buildable GUI
surface (Active-Frontier step 2) and already has a controlling prototype, a token
mirror, and a golden harness — so all three dispositions are exercisable today.
The intended trajectory is a **doc-by-doc pass** that applies this same discipline
to the other GUI specs as each surface reaches buildable definition — e.g. the
marking-menu shell (`DATUM_GUI_CONTEXT_MENU_CONTENT.md`, Active-Frontier step 3),
the command console (step 4), and the schematic/library surfaces (step 6) — each
turning its own prototype/claims into an actionable, honestly-dispositioned
conformance rail. This spec is the **template and precedent** for that pass; it does
not itself perform it. Sequencing for the rollout lives in the Active Frontier
(`specs/PROGRESS.md`), which threads each surface's conformance rail behind the
build slice it governs.
